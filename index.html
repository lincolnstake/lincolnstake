                    <h1>Lincoln Stake, Idaho :: Photo and Video Submission</h1>
                    <p>In order to encourage participation in Stake activities, we are accepting recent pictures from church activities that we can show during stake conference.</p>
                    <p>Since we are volunteers, and there is the potential for a wide range of submissions, we ask that you consider the following:</p>
                    <h3> Requests: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> We combine the collected photos every six months for conference so photos you submit should be no older than roughly six months old.</li>
                        <li> Images should be identified so that we know what they are from. For ward activities, include the Ward name. Date, Location, and Event/Activity are useful. You could put this information in a folder name, in a text file in the applicable folder, or in the individual file name. (*See note about missionaries) </li>
                        <li> Do not worry about labeling people in the photo at this time. (*See note about missionaries) </li>
                        <li> Be sure to have permission from the person that snapped the photo</li>
                        <li> Try to submit only tasteful photos with which the parents of or people in the photos would be okay</li>
                        <li> You do not need to send a large quantity of photos/video. Quality is probably better than quantity here </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> Please Do Not Submit</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Photos that include people who do not represent the teachings of the Church in their dress, grooming, gestures, and so on. </li>
                        <li> Out-of-focus or blurry photos </li>
                        <li> Photos of people in swimming suits </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> How to Submit</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Media may be submitted to either your ward (or branch) historian or directly to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/IqOfFonFRXyCRUD7lEgt">this dropbox.</a> This is faster than submitting them by email.</li>
                        <li> Dropbox will ask for your name and email address. This will allow us to contact you if we have further questions.</li>
                        <li> You may combine all of your media into a zip file if that is easier for you. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>*Note About Missionaries</h4>
                    Is there a full-time missionary in your family? We want to show a little bit of what missionaries from our stake are doing. Send up to 3 photos or a video and we will consider showing them during Stake Conference. These don't have to be serious but they should be church-appropriate. Missionaries will be identified by name; please include their name as part of the filename.

                    <p>Thank you for your efforts!</p>
